GREETINGS! This program is for educational purposes only. 
    This is a partial requirement of our course Capstone 1 and 2. 
    This project was coded starting from June 21, 2023 until February 12, 2024. 
    Through our rigor and determination, we made this system for a second time. 
    The languages used are the following: pghp and js that includes html and css. 

ALL ABOUT THE PROJECT 
    The group aspire to design and deveop a ordering system that will streamline the business operations
        of their beneficiary, the To Die For Foods. This system is has digital menu, kitchen display system,
        simple point-of-sale system, and invetory system. This has been tested (alpha and beta testing) with 
        their adviser, and TDF staff and customers. As for the software quality, survey has been conducted through 
        measuring the FURP model (Functinality, Usability, Reliability, and Performance.  
    The system allows to process order from a digital menu, modify all the content (menu and inventory), and outputs
        simple report in admin and receipt in cashier side.
    The programmers will be happy at your advices and suggestions regarding their system. 
    They believed that no perfect system exist and doesn't mean it will be excluded from innovation 
        and development. They hope that their system will be upgraded and debugged.
